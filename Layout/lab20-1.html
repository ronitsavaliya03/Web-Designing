            the largest and densest of the inner planets, the only one
            known to have current geological activity, and the only place
            where life is known to exist.[85] Its liquid hydrosphere is
            unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet
            where plate tectonics has been observed. Earth's atmosphere
            is radically different from those of the other planets, having
            been altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free
            oxygen.[86] It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only
            large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System</div>
