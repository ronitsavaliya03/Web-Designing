        <h1>â€¢Structure and Composition of Solar System:</h1>
The principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a G2
main-sequence star that contains 99.86% of the system's
known mass and dominates it gravitationally.[20] The Sun's
four largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for 99%
of the remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together
comprising more than 90%. The remaining objects of the
Solar System (including the four terrestrial planets, the dwarf
planets, moons, asteroids, and comets) together comprise
less than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass.[e]
Most large objects in orbit around the Sun lie near the plane
of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. The planets are very
close to the ecliptic, whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects
are frequently at significantly greater angles to it.[24][25] As a
result of the formation of the Solar System, planets (and most
other objects) orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun
is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's
north pole).[26] There are exceptions, such as Halley's
Comet. Most of the larger moons orbit their planets in this
prograde direction (with Triton being the largest retrograde
exception) and most larger objects rotate themselves in the
same direction (with Venus being a notable retrograde
exception).
The overall structure of the charted regions of the Solar
System consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner planets
surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant
planets surrounded by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects.
Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into
separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four
terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar
System is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant
planets.[27] Since the discovery of the Kuiper belt, the
outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct
region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.
