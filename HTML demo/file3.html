        <h1>•Discovery and Exploration</h1>
        <h2><p>For most of history, humanity did not recognize or understand
            the concept of the Solar System. Most people up to the Late
            Middle Ages–Renaissance believed Earth to be stationary at
            the centre of the universe and categorically different from the
            divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky.
            Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had
            speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos,
            Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically
            predictive heliocentric system.
            In the 17th century, Galileo discovered that the Sun was
            marked with sunspots, and that Jupiter had four satellites in
            orbit around it.[13] Christiaan Huygens followed on from
            Galileo's discoveries by discovering Saturn's moon Titan and
            the shape of the rings of Saturn.[14] Around 1677, Edmond
            Halley observed a transit of Mercury across the Sun, leading
            him to realise that observations of the solar parallax of a
            planet (more ideally using the transit of Venus) could be used
            to trigonometrically determine the distances between Earth,
            Venus, and the Sun.[15] In 1705, Halley realised that
            repeated sightings of a comet were of the same object,
            returning regularly once every 75–76 years. This was the first
            evidence that anything other than the planets orbited the
            Sun,[16] though this had been theorized about comets in the
            1st century by Seneca.[17] Around 1704, the term "Solar
            System" first appeared in English.[18] In 1838, Friedrich
            Bessel successfully measured a stellar parallax, an apparent
            shift in the position of a star created by Earth's motion around
            the Sun, providing the first direct, experimental proof of
            heliocentrism.[19] Improvements in observational astronomy
            and the use of uncrewed spacecraft have since enabled the
            detailed investigation of other bodies orbiting the Sun</p></h2>
