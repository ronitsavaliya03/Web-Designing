        <h1>SUN</h1>
        <h2>The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive
component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses),[59] which
comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System,[60]
produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to
sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, making it a
main-sequence star.[61] This releases an enormous amount of
energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation
peaking in visible light.[62]
The Sun is a G2-type main-sequence star. Hotter main-sequence
stars are more luminous. The Sun's temperature is intermediate
between that of the hottest stars and that of the coolest stars.
Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas
substantially dimmer and cooler stars, known as red dwarfs, make
up 85% of the stars in the Milky Way.[63][64]
The Sun is a population I star; it has a higher abundance of
elements heavier than hydrogen and helium ("metals" in
astronomical parlance) than the older population II stars.[65]
Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the
cores of ancient and exploding stars, so the first generation of
stars had to die before the universe could be enriched with these
atoms. The oldest stars contain few metals, whereas stars born
later have more. This high metallicity is thought to have been
crucial to the Sun's development of a planetary system because
the planets form from the accretion of "metals"</h2>
